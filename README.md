# Wavelet-Based Image Compression Project

This repository holds a comprehensive exploration of image compression using wavelet transform, particularly focusing on achieving high compression rates without significantly compromising image quality.

## Overview
The project delves into the principles of image redundancy and the effective use of wavelet transform for image compression. It aims to balance the trade-off between compression rate and image quality, evidenced through a series of experiments and analyses.

## Key Features
- Exploration of image redundancy and wavelet theory.
- Implementation of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image compression.
- Quantitative analysis of compression using various wavelet types and parameters.
- Detailed experimentations to find the optimal balance between compression rate and image quality.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [URL]

2. Install required libraries (e.g., Python's PyWavelets).
3. Run the scripts in the `/src` directory to compress images and analyze the results.
